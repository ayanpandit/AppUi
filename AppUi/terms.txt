Welcome to APP.UI. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the APP.UI website, web app, and any related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by the project maintainers.

3. Use of content and components
--------------------------------
The Service provides a curated collection of UI components, previews, and code snippets for educational and development purposes. All component source files, code snippets, and examples are provided "as-is" and may be subject to individual licenses found in the project's repository or accompanying files. Please check the repository and individual component code headers for licensing details before reuse.

4. User conduct

- impersonate another person or entity, or provide false information.

5. Intellectual property
------------------------
All trademarks, service marks, logos, and brand assets displayed on the Service are the property of their respective owners. The project source code (unless otherwise marked) is owned by the repository owner(s). Use of code is governed by the license in the repository (e.g., MIT, Apache, etc.) — always check the repository license.

6. Disclaimers and warranties
-----------------------------
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE MAINTAINERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE PROJECT AND ITS COMPONENTS MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE WITHOUT REVIEW, TESTING, AND ADAPTATION.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the project maintainers from any claim, liability, loss, or expense (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.

9. Termination
--------------
The maintainers may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time for any reason, including if you violate these Terms.

10. Third-party services
------------------------
The Service may include integrations or links to third-party services (e.g., GitHub, Spline, analytics providers). Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

11. Changes to the Terms
